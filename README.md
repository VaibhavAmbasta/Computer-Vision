# Computer-Vision
# yolo, face recognition, neural style transfer

Welcome to my Computer-Vision repository!

This repository has all the projects I did as part of the Convolutional Neural Networks course(part of Deep Learning Specialization) on Coursera.

As a result, I am now able to:

-build CNNs, including recent variations such as the residual network.

-build a face recognition system.

-implement YOLO

-applying CNNs to visual detection and recognition tasks.

-generating art using neural style transfer.

-applying these algorithms to a variety of image, video and other 2d, 3d data.
